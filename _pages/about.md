I'm a fifth-year PhD student in Prof. Justin Solomon's [Geometric Data Processing Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/) at the [MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu/). I work on **machine learning** problems where **scale fails**: Where naively scaling up training data, model size, or the number of training iterations is either impossible, fails to yield the promised improvements, or even leads to unexpected – and unwanted – results. I'm grateful to be supported by a 2024 Exponent Fellowship. I've also been supported by a 2022 Siebel Scholarship and an NSERC Postgraduate Doctoral Scholarship (PGS-D).

I spent Summer 2024 interning with Dr. Paul Zhang at Backflip AI, a 3D generative AI startup based in San Francisco. We developed a state-of-the-art method for orienting 3D shapes, which you can read all about in [Orient Anything](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02101).

I spent Summer 2021 and 2022 interning with  Prof. [Michael Bronstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bronstein) and the Learning Methods team at Twitter [Cortex](https://cortex.twitter.com/)!

I completed my undergrad degree in mathematics and economics at McGill University in Montreal. At McGill, I had the privilege of working with:

- Profs. [Rustum Choksi](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rchoksi/) and [Tim Hoheisel](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/hoheisel/), with whom I helped develop a state-of-the-art algorithm for QR code deblurring.
- Prof. [Adrian Vetta](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/vetta/), with whom I worked on efficient approximation schemes for fair chore division and scheduling problems.
- Prof. [Prakash Panangaden](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/), with whom I worked on efficiently computable approximations to optimal transport distances.
