I'm a second-year PhD student in Prof. Justin Solomon's [Geometric Data Processing Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/) at MIT! I work on geometric problems in machine learning, with a particular emphasis on geometric deep learning and optimal transport. 

I spent last summer interning with  Prof. [Michael Bronstein](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.bronstein) and the Learning Methods team at Twitter [Cortex](https://cortex.twitter.com/)!

Some of my active projects include:

- Learning-augmented dynamical optimal transport, which allows for the advection of probability measures along learnable paths.
- Fokker-Planck message passing, which enables directional, long-distance feature aggregation across the nodes of continuously-embedded graphs.
- Building chemically meaningful distance measures for mass spectrometry output data. (The downstream problem: Given the mass spectrum of an unknown molecule, can we identify the spectrum of the "most chemically similar" molecule in a database of known mass spectra?)

Check out my [Publications](https://cscarv.github.io/publications) page to learn more about past projects that I've worked on.

I'm grateful to be supported by a 2022 Siebel Scholarship and an NSERC PGS-D Scholarship.

Background
======
I'm a PhD candidate in Prof. Justin Solomon's [Geometric Data Processing Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/) at the [MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu/).

I completed my undergrad degree in mathematics and economics at McGill University in Montreal. At McGill, I had the privilege of working with:

- Profs. [Rustum Choksi](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rchoksi/) and [Tim Hoheisel](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/hoheisel/), with whom I helped develop a state-of-the-art algorithm for QR code deblurring.
- Prof. [Adrian Vetta](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/vetta/), with whom I worked on efficient approximation schemes for fair chore division and scheduling problems.
- Prof. [Prakash Panangaden](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/), with whom I worked on efficiently computable approximations to optimal transport distances.
