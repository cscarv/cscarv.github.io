I'm excited to be joining Prof. Justin Solomon's [Geometric Data Processing Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/) at MIT in the fall! I'll be working on geometric problems in machine learning, with a particular emphasis on computational optimal transport.

I'm currently completing a research internship at McGill University in Montreal under Prof. Prakash Panangaden. We're working on developing efficiently computable approximations to optimal transport distances.

Check out my [Publications](https://cscarv.github.io/publications) page to learn more about the projects I've worked on.

Background
======
I'm an incoming PhD candidate at Prof. Justin Solomon's [Geometric Data Processing Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/) at the [MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu/).

I completed my undergrad degree in mathematics and economics at McGill University in Montreal. At McGill, I had the privilege of working with:

- Profs. [Rustum Choksi](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rchoksi/) and [Tim Hoheisel](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/hoheisel/), with whom I helped develop a state-of-the-art algorithm for QR code deblurring.
- Prof. [Adrian Vetta](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/vetta/), with whom I worked on efficient approximation schemes for fair chore division and scheduling problems.
- Prof. [Prakash Panangaden](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/), with whom I worked on efficiently computable approximations to optimal transport distances.
