I recently joined Prof. Justin Solomon's [Geometric Data Processing Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/) at MIT! I work on geometric problems in machine learning, with a particular emphasis on geometric deep learning and optimal transport. Some of my active projects include:

- An academic collaboration with [InVivo AI](https://www.invivoai.com/). We're developing self-supervised techniques to automatically learn 3D-structure-aware vector representations of molecules from their molecular graphs.
- Building chemically meaningful distance measures for mass spectrometry output data. (The downstream problem: Given the mass spectrum of an unknown molecule, can we identify the spectrum of the "most chemically similar" molecule in a database of known mass spectra?)
- Learning to hierarchically aggregate features from unstructured data.

Background
======
I'm a PhD candidate in Prof. Justin Solomon's [Geometric Data Processing Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/) at the [MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu/).

I completed my undergrad degree in mathematics and economics at McGill University in Montreal. At McGill, I had the privilege of working with:

- Profs. [Rustum Choksi](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rchoksi/) and [Tim Hoheisel](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/hoheisel/), with whom I helped develop a state-of-the-art algorithm for QR code deblurring.
- Prof. [Adrian Vetta](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/vetta/), with whom I worked on efficient approximation schemes for fair chore division and scheduling problems.
- Prof. [Prakash Panangaden](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/), with whom I worked on efficiently computable approximations to optimal transport distances.
