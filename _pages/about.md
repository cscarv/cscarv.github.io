I'm a third-year PhD student in Prof. Justin Solomon's [Geometric Data Processing Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/) at the [MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu/), where I work on methods for learning geometric structure for non-Euclidean data. I'm grateful to be supported by a 2022 Siebel Scholarship and an NSERC PGS-D Scholarship.

I've spent Summer 2021 and 2022 interning with  Prof. [Michael Bronstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bronstein) and the Learning Methods team at Twitter [Cortex](https://cortex.twitter.com/)!

I completed my undergrad degree in mathematics and economics at McGill University in Montreal. At McGill, I had the privilege of working with:

- Profs. [Rustum Choksi](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rchoksi/) and [Tim Hoheisel](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/hoheisel/), with whom I helped develop a state-of-the-art algorithm for QR code deblurring.
- Prof. [Adrian Vetta](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/vetta/), with whom I worked on efficient approximation schemes for fair chore division and scheduling problems.
- Prof. [Prakash Panangaden](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/), with whom I worked on efficiently computable approximations to optimal transport distances.
