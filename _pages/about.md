I'm currently a research intern with  Prof. [Michael Bronstein](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.bronstein) and the Twitter [Cortex](https://cortex.twitter.com/) group! 

I recently joined Prof. Justin Solomon's [Geometric Data Processing Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/) at MIT! I work on geometric problems in machine learning, with a particular emphasis on geometric deep learning and optimal transport. Some of my active projects include:

- Developing an extension of the Benamou-Brenier formulation of optimal transport to allow for the advection of probability measures along learnable paths.
- Building chemically meaningful distance measures for mass spectrometry output data. (The downstream problem: Given the mass spectrum of an unknown molecule, can we identify the spectrum of the "most chemically similar" molecule in a database of known mass spectra?)

Background
======
I'm a PhD candidate in Prof. Justin Solomon's [Geometric Data Processing Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/) at the [MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu/).

I completed my undergrad degree in mathematics and economics at McGill University in Montreal. At McGill, I had the privilege of working with:

- Profs. [Rustum Choksi](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rchoksi/) and [Tim Hoheisel](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/hoheisel/), with whom I helped develop a state-of-the-art algorithm for QR code deblurring.
- Prof. [Adrian Vetta](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/vetta/), with whom I worked on efficient approximation schemes for fair chore division and scheduling problems.
- Prof. [Prakash Panangaden](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/), with whom I worked on efficiently computable approximations to optimal transport distances.
