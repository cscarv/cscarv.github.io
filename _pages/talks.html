In November 2021, I delivered a guest lecture on geometric deep learning for [MIT 6.S898](https://phillipi.github.io/6.s898/), a topics course in modern deep learning. You can access the slides [here](https://phillipi.github.io/6.s898/lectures/scarvelis_11_7.pdf).

In August 2021, I gave a survey talk titled "Optimal Transport in Practice" at Twitter's Machine Learning Seminar.
