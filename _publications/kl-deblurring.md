QR codes enable businesses to seamlessly link their physical and digital marketing campaigns by offering audiences the option to quickly access a business' website (or any other digital asset) using their smartphone.

Camera blur is a common roadblock in this process, frustrating consumers and making them less likely to follow through with their interaction with a digital campaign. An effective deblurring algorithm mitigates this issue by allowing the QR code reader to receive a usable signal even when the underlying image of the QR code is blurry.

In collaboration with Profs. Rustum Choksi and Tim Hoheisel and my colleague Gabriel Rioux, I helped develop the state of the art algorithm for deblurring QR codes. Our method is able to handle far more severe blurs than have previously been considered in the literature. As a bonus, it's easy to implement using well-documented Python packages.
