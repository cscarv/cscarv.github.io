This paper extends our earlier work on QR code deblurring to the case of general images. We develop a deblurring algorithm that achieves strong results on images that include calibration patterns and in cases where the blur kernel is known in advance.

### Technical summary

As in our earlier paper ["Blind Deblurring of Barcodes via Kullback-Leibler Divergence"](https://cscarv.github.io/publication/kl-deblurring), we use Fenchel-Rockafellar duality to transform an infinite-dimensional optimization problem over a space of probability measures into a smooth, convex, and finite-dimensional dual problem. We provide a novel stability analysis for our method and examine the role of the prior measure in our problem.
